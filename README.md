WORD FINDER	
The objective is to solve the proposal in the following way. I try with the least amount of iterations possible, but in case of iterating, I try to make the iteration have the least amount of logical conditions, in this way the high performance is the most important thing to solve.
I receive a matrix and convert it vector with all possible vertical and horizontal lines. Next, I use the strategy of type window to look up the word received

 If I find the word, I add it to the list and, finally, I resolve to group by and count the words found and return the first 10 most repeated
The architecture is very simple:
* API
* Services and Businesses
* Test

I donÂ´t use DI or library (Ex: FluentValidation) I decided a simple paradigm of POO and principle SOLID
